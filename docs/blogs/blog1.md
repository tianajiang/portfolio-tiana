# The Unintended Effects of Pokemon GO

In class, we talked about software having unintended consequences on its many stakeholders. This reminded me of the unintended consequences caused Pokemon GO a few years ago. Pokemon GO is a game that combines the virtual Pokemon world with the real physical world, sending players on missions to explore real nearby areas looking for virtual Pokemon. This was designed and marketed as a novel game that encouraged kids to explore outside amidst the growing epidemic of indoor screen time. However, this design led to several unintended consequences. 

When it comes to indirect stakeholders, similar to Waze, non-players were affected when strangers started wandering into their neighborhoods in search of virtual Pokemon. Drivers and pedestrians on the road also had to be more cautious, as players drove or crossed the road while playing the game. Direct stakeholders (players) were also directly put in dangerous situations, following Pokemon into unfamiliar and possibly dangerous places. In particular, children, being more susceptible to distractions and less aware of potential dangers, were at heightened risk of encountering risky situations while playing.

The makers of Pokemon GO responded to these issues with the new features such as GO Drive Mode and No Pokemon Zones, which limit gameplay when the app detects that a player is driving or when the player is in a dangerous or busy traffic area. These seem on the surface like reasonable patches, but I wonder how exactly these features are implemented. Do they defeat the purpose of the game? For example, would the app think I was driving if I was riding public transit? Or maybe if I was a child riding in my parent’s car? Would the app consider me to be in a dangerous traffic area if I lived in New York City? These are very plausible situations to want to play the game in, and yet they are also situations in which gameplay might be restricted by these safety features. 

With hindsight, it seems like these safety concerns should have been obvious to the game makers before releasing the game. However, considering these patches were made after the game’s initial release, it’s clear that we as designers and engineers need to engage in much deeper consideration when it comes to the affects of our software on all stakeholders. Specifically with this Pokemon GO example, I wonder what you all think about these patch features and the implications of certain implementation choices.
