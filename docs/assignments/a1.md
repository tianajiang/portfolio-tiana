# Assignment 1: Social Media Needfinding

## Hunch
I would like to explore how social media can help people achieve and encourage others to achieve their health, fitness, and overall wellness goals.

## Interview Planning and Notes

In the following notes, **bold text** indicates scripted questions that I planned ahead of time, ***bold and italicized text*** indicates questions I improvised following the flow of the conversation, and regular text indicates the interviewee response.

## Interview 1 Notes: Donglu Xia

### Justification:
Donglu is much older than me (55 years old), a cancer patient, and recovering from a leg surgery, meaning that her methods for staying active and taking care of her health likely differ significantly from mine. She likely also interacts with social media differently from myself. I know from prior interactions with Donglu that she uses Facebook to connect with fellow cancer patients. This will provide a very unique perspective about the intersection between social media and health/wellness. I hope to learn how someone who has struggled with blows to her health can come back from these blows and continue to work on their health using social media.

### Notes:

- **What are some social media apps that you use often?**
    - Facebook, Messenger, WeChat, LinkedIn
    - **What do you use ____ (app) for? (entertainment, news, messaging, health, etc)**
        - Facebook for most things. See posts from friends, buy from Facebook Marketplace, 
        - Messenger to contact various people. Specifics she gave: to communicate with the people renting an apartment from her, to talk to her family
- **What types of exercise do you like to do? (expected answer is dancing/yoga from prior connection with Donglu)**
    - Dance, yoga, go on walks, yard work
    - **What motivates you to keep exercising?**
        - "I want to beat cancer so I can see my kids get married and my grandchildren born"
        - Seeing other people exercise/lose weight motivates her
    - **Is there anything that makes you feel unmotivated to exercise?**
        - Sometimes she feels like she is not making progress (body stays the same, doesn’t feel more energetic or healthier)
    - **Where do/did you learn how to do the exercises that you do?**
        - Youtube, Facebook group (more on this later), Google. She also asks ChatGPT to generate exercise routines for her
    - **Do you ever share your exercise routines with others? If so, where?**
        - No
- **What has your recovery from leg surgery been like?**
    - Good, just doing what doctor says (resting, not doing anything extreme)
    - ***Have you had to make significant changes to your exercise routines?***
        - Yes, hard to go on long walks now, need to do less bouncing when dancing
- **What else do you like to do for your mental, physical, emotional wellness? (ex. meditation, cooking, reading, hobbies)**
    - Sewing, cooking, reading, playing with pet cat, walks outside
    - **How do you discover new information or resources related to your health and wellness? (google, social media, tv, etc)**
        - Google, ChatGPT (similar answer to above)
- **I know from talking to you the past few years that you use Facebook to connect with fellow cancer patients. Can you tell me about how that works? (ex. Is it a group chat on messenger? A facebook page/group?)**
    - Fakebook group, people in the group can post things for everyone to see
    - **Do you know why this group initially chose to use Facebook and not some other app?**
        - She is not sure (group created long ago)
    - **How did you initially find/hear about this group?**
        - Word of mouth from her doctor who heard about it from another patient
    - **Can you show me the _____(page/chat/group) and how you interact with it? Do you often just scroll and stop on posts you are interested in? Or do you look for a specific type of post or posts from a specific person?**
        - She just scrolls (she is not sure how to find specific posts or people)
        - I notice she stops often on posts with pets in the photo and she smiles a genuine smile when seeing some of the posts of good news
    - **What type of content do people usually share here?**
        - Health updates (how treatment is going)
        - Questions (mostly ask about people’s experience on certain medications, what doctors to talk to in certain areas, resources)
        - Life updates (family, hobbies, exercise, etc.)
            - ***Can you tell me more about the life updates? What specific things do people post? How does it make you feel when you see them?***
                - Achieving or making new workout routines. She likes this because people in this group give good ideas for workouts to do with limited mobility and weak health
                - Sometimes she is annoyed because there are a few people who post too often.”One lady is very fit and looks good, which makes me feel bad about myself and like I can never achieve the body she has”
                - She feels happy to see people doing well
    - **Do you participate in discussions or post content yourself?**
        - **If yes, what kind of content?**
            - She responds to posts to congratulate people sometimes on good news, and responds to questions when she knows the answer
        - **What kind of responses do you typically get?**
            - None, sometimes just “thank you” when answering questions
        - **If no, why not?**
            - Does not post photos, mostly due to privacy
            - Would be okay if the photos only stayed within a smaller subset of the group
            - Does not want photos of herself publicly online
    - **What types of feelings do you feel when scrolling on this page?**
        - Mostly happy, sometimes concerned
        - Friends asking questions or experiencing worsening health conditions makes her worry that it will happen to her as well
        - Sometimes happy when she sees that she is “keeping up with others” in terms of health, almost like a competition of who can be the healthiest
        - Sometimes "ashamed when other people are achieving more than me"
        - Doesn’t want to use cancer as an excuse to not do anything with her life
    - **Can you describe a specific instance when you saw a post or received a response from someone that made you happy? Sad? Inspired?**
        - Happy: 
            - Lots of people post about going on walks with pets or family
            - Happy to see her friends active and happy
            - ***Does seeing this kind of post inspire you to do the same? Go on walks with your family?***
                - Yes! “We just went crabbing at Castle Island a few weeks ago because I saw my friend Mary in the cancer group went fishing with her kids.”
        - Sad:
            - Recently someone very active in cancer group and very healthy suddenly passed away
            - Felt as if her exercise might not be helping her at all, she could also pass away at any moment even if she is healthy/exercising
            - ***Does this make you feel less motivated to exercise?***
                - Sort of. “I know one healthy person dying doesn’t mean all healthy people will die suddenly, but seeing this story really rattled me.”
        - Inspired: 
            - Friend in cancer group gained weight and lost hair while on chemotherapy, recently posted that they are much better after finishing treatment, lost weight, had nice wig, generally looked healthier and happier
            - Inspired her to exercise more and work on her appearance and do more things that make her happy
            - “Maybe I wasn’t inspired; maybe I was jealous, but it made me work a lot harder and want to exercise more.”
                - ***Can you tell me more about this jealous feeling? It seems like there's a contradiction here. The people in this group are all your friends and that you wish the best for them on their cancer journey, but yet you are jealous.***
                    - Yes, she wishes for them to do well, but she feels she also selfishly wants herself to do better than them.

## Interview 2 Notes: Jung Park

### Justification:
Jung is a student at Cedar Valley Middle School, which has many school sports teams, yet she does not participate in any. In middle school, I played soccer and was on a dance team, so her middle school experience in terms of sports/fitness is substantially different from mine. She also is much younger than me and would provide a unique take on the social media experiences of the younger generation as opposed to Donglu’s experiences of the older generation. She loves TikTok, as a lot of young people do. Jung also recently quit her school swim team, which could provide insights into what motivates/does not motivate people to work on their health.

### Notes:

- **What are some social media apps that you use often?**
    - Tiktok (favorite), instagram, reddit, twitter/X, youtube
    - **What do you use ____ (app) for? (entertainment, news, messaging, health, etc)**
        - Tiktok: entertainment, funny/silly videos, looking for fashion trends, travel plans/ideas
        - Instagram: friends, celebrity/pop culture, book/reading content, posting aesthetic posts (especially travel)

        - Never uses following tab on TikTok (uses For You page)
        - Mostly just scroll (watch most of videos, not much skipping videos)
    - **How do you find communities of people that you want to interact with on these apps?**
        - Not many communities, sometimes just comment section of people she follows on TikTok/Instagram
    - **Do you follow any health or fitness related profiles on either app?**
        - Sort of, many content creators share fitness routines and photos at the gym even if that is not what they are famous for
        - ***How does it make you feel when you see these types of posts?***
            - Ashamed, problems with body image
            - Sometimes makes her want to exercise again

    - **What motivates you to exercise when you do?**
        - Band: “I call it trauma bonding... the hard part of marching band is the heat in Texas… Everyone else is doing it, so I’m doing it too. If everyone else can suffer through the heat, I can too.”

        - “I like seeing my exercise ring close on my Apple Watch”
    - **Is there anything that makes you feel unmotivated to exercise?**

        - Doesn’t like to sweat
        - ***What are some things that help you break past that initial barrier and just start exercising?***
            - A year ago she used to go to gym with sister and mom
            - Mom was very motivated and wanted to go to the gym with her 
            - Mom had routines in the gym and showed them to Jung so that she didn't have to come up with her own
            - Jung felt that if her mom could do it, she could do it too
            - “I felt guilty for bailing on my mom if I told her I would go but then didn't”
            - “Sometimes I get spurts of inspiration when I suddenly want to exercise, but it usually doesn’t last long”
                - ***What causes these spurts?***
                    - TV show: Physical 100 about competing to be the “most fit person”

                    - Youtube videos (very accessible and can see demonstration)
                    - Tiktok (shorter than youtube videos) so that she can just get the info and get exercising

## Interview 1 Report: Donglu

## Interview 2 Report: Jung

## Design Opportunities
1. **Communities**
    - What is the design opportunity?
        - Current social media does not offer easy ways to create, find, and join communities. Even with Facebook, which has many diverse groups, it is difficult for users to locate these communities that precisely match their needs. For example, Donglu only heard about the Facebook cancer group through word of mouth.
    - Why is this important for Donglu?
        - For Donglu, it is very important in her fitness journey that she sees content from people who are going through cancer just like her. Seeing “super fit” people made her feel bad about herself and feel unmotivated. It would benefit her to join communities where others also have cancer, are recovering from injuries, or are around her age.
    - Why is this important for Jung?
        - Jung felt discouraged when she couldn’t keep up with others in swim team, leading her to quit. Joining a community where others share a similar fitness level could provide the encouragement and understanding needed to stay committed.
2. **Goal sharing**
    - What is the design opportunity?
        - Current social media lacks integrated features for users to keep themselves accountable, so a design opportunity could be to explore some type of way to keep yourself and others on track for fitness goals.
    - Why is this important for Jung?
        - Jung mentioned feeling guilty about promising her mom that she would go to the gym with her and then backing out, which motivated her to keep going to the gym. Having a some way to share goals and commitments with others can provide similar accountability, creating a sense of responsibility for users to follow through on their health and fitness goals.
3. **Competition/Gamification**
    - What is the design opportunity?
        - Gamifying things and adding a sense of competition makes users more interested and determined. Therefore, one design opportunity is to consider how we can gamify exercise and wellness to motivate users.
    - Why is this important for Donglu?
        - Donglu remarked that she felt motivated and when she was "keeping up with others" in terms of health. This subtle competitive aspect made her more driven and engaged in her fitness routine.
    - Why is this important for Jung?
        - Jung talked about how she enjoyed a bit of lighthearted competition, which is why she liked playing badminton with her dad. She also remarked that seeing the closed exercise ring on her Apple watch (meaning that she completed her daily exercise goal) motivated her to exercise.
4. **Library of exercises/challenges**
    - What is the design opportunity?
        - There is currently no easy way for friends to share workout routines with one another, yet this could act as a great source of inspiration for users to start exercising. One design opportunity would be to consider how we can create a library of routines or wellness challenges that users can contribute to.
    - Why this is important for Jung:
        - Jung explained that being able to just use her mom's workout routine
