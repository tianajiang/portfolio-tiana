## Broad Application Goals
Fit Kit: Your Kit for a Strong Start to Fitness


## Scrapbook of Comparables

### Slack

![Slack Kudos Bot](/images/kudos.png){:width="600"}

In Slack, the Kudos Bot allows you to message a Slack bot and easily give kudos to your coworkers for doing good work. The bot automatically formats your message and sends it to your coworkers. I wonder if I could make something similar for my app that allows users to congratulate or give kudos to others who are doing well on their fitness journey.


### Quizlet

![Quizlet Learn Function](/images/quizlet2.png){:width="600"}

These photos show Quizlet's "Learn" function. When you learn by practicing flashcards, depending on if you correctly recall the answer to a flashcard, you can select to either mark the flashcard as "Still Learning" or "Know". Then, the next time you use the Learn function to study your flashcards, you can choose to autmatically sort cards for a personalized study session based on how well you know each card. I wonder if this can be applied to my app in order to help people improve their fitness practices and work little bby little to learn specific skills.


### Pinterest

![Pinterest Boards](/images/pinterest.jpg){:width="600"}

In Pinterest, users can collect others's posts into boards (similar to folders) and display them on their profile for friends to see. Users can also file their own posts into these boards. Maybe my app could have similar functionality for sorting different exercise types and posts.


### Life360

<div style="display: flex;">
  <div style="margin-right: 10px;">
    <img src="/images/life3601.png" height="200"/>
  </div>
  <div>
    <img src="/images/life3602.png" height="200"/>
  </div>
</div>

In Life360, you can track where your friends have been throughout the day, as long as they have shared their location with you. Using the slider at the bottom of the page, you can see your friend's location at different times of day and how much time they spent there. Maybe this could be applied to my fitness social media app to let users share their location while on a run so that friends can follow the same running paths.


### Forest

![Forest Focus App](/images/forest.png){:width="600"}

Forest is an app that helps you focus by planting trees for you to take care of. It includes a feature that allows you to "blacklist" sites that you know you are often distracted by. For example, if you want to work for 1 hour without using TikTok or YouTube, you can place those sites on the blacklist and start a plant a 1 hour tree. Once the hour is over, if you stayed away from TikTok and YouTube, your tree will be grown and healthy and will be added to your forest. However, if you get distracted and visit a blacklisted site, your tree will die. Maybe I can do something similar in my app to keep users focused and motivated for their fitness goals.


<!-- hinge/tinder - fill out your preferences and the app will suggest workouts, and you can swipe the ones you like/dont like to save then to your folder of workouts to try in the future

period tracker diary - allow users to talk about their emotions/feelings that day, could help user son days when they don't feel so well and reflect


pinterest boards - users can collect similar posts on pinterest into a board that can be seen by others (collect workouts into folders or personal posts into folders) (ex all the walks ive been on with my dog this year, or all the times i worked out with my daughter, or my leg recovery journey) -->





## Feature Brainstorming
- **Community filters**: Users will be able to join a wide variety of very specific communitites. The "community filters" feature will allow users to filter communities by age, fitness level, workout/sport type, injuries, health conditions, and more.
- **Library of Exercises**: There will be a large library of possible exercises/workouts that users can choose from when. This is especially good for beginners who don't know where to begin with their workouts.
- **Demonstration Shorts**: Each workout/exercise will have a corresponding short video that demonstrates how to do the workout with proper form. Preferably, the demonstration is not done by someone who looks extremely fit, and is instead someone more relatable to users.
- **Personal Library**: Users can make their own personal libraries of exercises that they like to do. They can also share these with friends.
- **Goal Setting**: Users can choose from a variety of goal types and time frames, and the app will automatically create a schedule to help them achieve the goal. For example, if the goal is to go on a walk at least 10 times in a month, the app might schedule a walk once every three days to help the user achieve this goal.
- **Goal Sharing**: User A can share their goals with some User B such that the goal shows up on User B's feed/app main page. This way, the User B can keep an eye on User A's progress and help keep them accountable and committed to the goal.
- **Streaks**: Users will have a streak of x days if they exercise for x days in a row. If they miss a day, this streak resets to 0. This streak will be shown on a user's profile so that they can be proud of keeping up with exercise for some number of days in a row! Users can also set streaks to be number of weeks in a row (since daily workouts might not be realistic for some).
- **Challenge Sharing**: Users can send challenges to their communities so that all members of the community can participate in the same challenge together. The community page will show members who participated and celebrate their achievement with others.
- **Daily Challenge**: 
- **Workout Tracking**:
- **progress graphs**
- **other tracking** (what weight did you last use, what ot use next?)
- **Gym finder/machine finder** what gyms in your area have the machines/equipment you need?
- **stretches**: what stretches should i do before starting a certain workout
- **modifications** how to modify exercises for beginner/injury
- **goal score**: number of goals you've set and complete
- **pets/plants**: take care of your pet/plant by working out (if you stop using app, pet/plant will die)
- **pomodoro timer**: 
- **community leaderboards** who is the most improved this week? exercised for most minutes? etc
- **neighborhoods**: you automatically get added to the neighborhood your location is in so people can meet up in person to exercise together
- **community goals**: ex. a community sets a goal to get 500 minutes of exercise combined between all members
- **Kudos**: users can give weekly kudos to another member of their community to congratulate them on work well done or new achievements.
- **gym locater**



## Value Sensitive Design Analysis

long term if more and more people use it, it might lose the "beginner friendly" vibe if more experience gym people join

## Storyboarding and Sketching
