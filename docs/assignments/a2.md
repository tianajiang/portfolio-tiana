# Assignment 2: Divergent Design

## Broad Application Goals

**Name:** Fit Kit: *Your Kit for a Strong Start to Fitness*

**Audience/Value:** This app is designed for those who are beginning their fitness journey, have trouble staying consistent and commited to their health, are recovering from injury, or are otherwise in need of a more accessible approach to fitness. Unlike other apps, which primarily cater to experienced users by focusing on tracking personal records or advanced metrics, Fit Kit prioritizes accessibility for all. It offers content that resonates personally with each user, featuring workouts and posts from friends and peers with similar experiences and fitness levels. Fit Kit ensures that users feel supported, motivated, and understood rather than feeling discouraged or excluded because they can't lift as much as others or can't run as fast.

## Scrapbook of Comparables

### Slack

![Slack Kudos Bot](/images/kudos.png){:width="600"}

In Slack, the Kudos Bot allows you to message a Slack bot and easily give kudos to your coworkers for doing good work. The bot automatically formats your message and sends it to your coworkers. I wonder if I could make something similar for my app that allows users to congratulate or give kudos to others who are doing well on their fitness journey.


### Quizlet

![Quizlet Flashcard](/images/quizlet1.png){:width="600"}
![Quizlet Learn Function](/images/quizlet2.png){:width="600"}

These photos show Quizlet's "Learn" function. When you learn by practicing flashcards, depending on if you correctly recall the answer to a flashcard, you can select to either mark the flashcard as "Still Learning" or "Know". Then, the next time you use the Learn function to study your flashcards, you can choose to autmatically sort cards for a personalized study session based on how well you know each card. I wonder if this can be applied to my app in order to help people improve their fitness practices and work little by little to learn specific skills.


### Pinterest

![Pinterest Boards](/images/pinterest.jpg){:width="600"}

In Pinterest, users can collect others's posts into boards (similar to folders) and display them on their profile for friends to see. Users can also file their own posts into these boards. Maybe my app could have similar functionality for sorting different exercise types and posts.


### Life360

    <img src="/images/life3602.png" height="200"/>
  </div>
</div>

In Life360, you can track where your friends have been throughout the day, as long as they have shared their location with you. Using the slider at the bottom of the page, you can see your friend's location at different times of day and how much time they spent there. Maybe this could be applied to my fitness social media app to let users share their location while on a run so that friends can follow the same running paths.


### Forest

![Forest Focus App](/images/forest.png){:width="600"}

Forest is an app that helps you focus by planting trees for you to take care of. It includes a feature that allows you to "blacklist" sites that you know you are often distracted by. For example, if you want to work for 1 hour without using TikTok or YouTube, you can place those sites on the blacklist and start a plant a 1 hour tree. Once the hour is over, if you stayed away from TikTok and YouTube, your tree will be grown and healthy and will be added to your forest. However, if you get distracted and visit a blacklisted site, your tree will die. Maybe I can do something similar in my app to keep users focused and motivated for their fitness goals.


<!-- hinge/tinder - fill out your preferences and the app will suggest workouts, and you can swipe the ones you like/dont like to save then to your folder of workouts to try in the future

period tracker diary - allow users to talk about their emotions/feelings that day, could help user son days when they don't feel so well and reflect


pinterest boards - users can collect similar posts on pinterest into a board that can be seen by others (collect workouts into folders or personal posts into folders) (ex all the walks ive been on with my dog this year, or all the times i worked out with my daughter, or my leg recovery journey) -->





## Feature Brainstorming

- **Community filters**: Users will be able to join a wide variety of very specific communitites. The "community filters" feature will allow users to filter communities by age, workout/sport type, injuries, health conditions, fitness level, and more. This will help users to find peers with similar experiences and goals, creating a sense of belonging for users who are beginning their fitness journey.
- **Library of Exercises**: There will be a large library of possible exercises/workouts and modifications to these workouts that users can choose from. This is especially good for beginners who don't know where to begin with their workouts, or those who need modifications to existing exercises due to injuries. Users can suggest/create additional exercises to be added to the library if they don't already exist, and after approval the exercise will be added to the global library for all users.
- **Demonstration Shorts**: Each workout/exercise will have a corresponding short video that demonstrates how to do the workout with proper form. Preferably, the demonstration is not done by a trainer or someone who looks extremely fit, and is instead someone more relatable to users.
- **Personal Library**: Users can create personalized libraries of exercises they enjoy and share these collections with friends. This feature allows users to discover and benefit from workouts that others at the same fitness level have found effective.
- **Goal Setting**: Users can choose from a variety of goal types and time frames, and the app will automatically create a schedule to help them achieve the goal. For example, if the goal is to go on a walk at least 10 times in a month, the app might schedule a walk once every three days to help the user achieve this goal. This helps users ignore the difficult planning aspect and focus solely on their fitness.
- **Goal Sharing**: User A can share their goals with some User B such that the goal shows up on User B's feed/app main page. This way, the User B can keep an eye on User A's progress and help keep them accountable and committed to the goal. This feature is especially beneficial for users who find it difficult to stay motivated on their own
- **Year Wrapped**: Similar to Spotify Wrapped, users will have a yearly summary highlighting their total workout minutes, most frequent exercises, progress toward goals, and more notable achievements. This feature will celebrate their efforts and offers insights to help them set new goals for the upcoming year.
- **Streaks**: Users will have a streak of x days if they exercise for x days in a row. If they miss a day, this streak resets to 0. This streak will be shown on a user's profile so that they can be proud of keeping up with exercise for some number of days in a row. Users can also set streaks to be number of weeks in a row (since daily workouts might not be realistic for many). This again helps users maintain motivation.
- **Challenge Sharing**: Users can send challenges to their communities so that all members of the community can participate in the same challenge together. The community page will show members who participated and celebrate their achievement with others.
- **Learn Mode**: Users can filter exercises as "learning" or "learned" based on how well they are able to complete the exercise. When in "learn mode", the app will create a workout for the user, helping them practice the exercises that are still in the "learning" state.
- **Run Route Tracker**: Users can track their location during a run, receiving metrics such as mile splits and total distance. Additionally, they can save their favorite running routes for future reference and share these with friends, allowing others to enjoy the same routes.
- **Progress Graphs**: These graphs provide a visual representation of a user's fitness journey by tracking key metrics over time, such as workout duration, exercise intensity, and overall progress towards their goals. This offers a clear and motivating view of achievements, helping users to easily identify trends, celebrate milestones, and stay focused on long-term goals.
- **Pets/Plants**: Users can choose a virtual pet or plant to take care of! They can feed their pet or water their plant by completing challenges and exercises. Their pet or plant will grow along with users over the course of their fitness journey, keeping them motivated and giving them a sense of responsibility to stick to their goals.
- **Pomodoro Timer**: Users can set pomodoro timers that lock them out of other apps in order to maintain focus. This helps users stay disciplined and efficient in their exercise routines by minimizing distractions and encouraging dedicated workout periods.
- **New User Buddies**: New users who opt in will be paired with a more "veteran" user for guidance and support as they start their fitness journey.
- **Leaderboards**: Each week, the app recognizes top performers in each community to create some friendly competition. Some metrics for "top performer" include highest total exercise minutes or highest number of completed challenges or goals.
- **Neighborhoods**: Users are automatically added to a neighborhood group based on their location, making it easy for users to arrange in-person exercise meetups. 
- **Kudos**: Users can give one kudos per week to another member of each of their communities. Because the kudos is cannot be given very often, it will be a special experience to recieve a kudos! This will motivate users and foster a supportive community environment.
- **Gym Locator**: Based on the exercises a user want to do, the gym locator will show a list of gyms nearby that have the necessary equipment to complete these exercises. This is particularly useful for beginners who may not be familiar with local gyms and facilities, helping them find gyms that are well-equipped for their needs.
- **Exercise/Post Boards**: Users can file different exercises and posts into different categories and display them on their profile page. For example, a user could create folders called "Dance Workouts" and "Gentle Morning Workouts" that their friends can also reference when they need inspiration. For personal posts, users can create folders such as "Walks with My Puppy" or "Running Scenery" to keep a diary of every time they went on a walk with their dog or every cool scenic location they saw on runs.
- **Workout Swap**: Every week, the app suggests a workout from someone in the user's communities that aligns with their fitness interests but introduces new exercises or routines. This feature encourages users to explore fresh, varied workouts while staying connected with the preferences and experiences of others in their community.



## Value Sensitive Design Analysis

long term if more and more people use it, it might lose the "beginner friendly" vibe if more experience gym people join

- **Values**: When **choosing desired values** of this app, we need to consider the inclusivity and exclusivity of the Leaderboards feature. While being on the leaderboard should be a special and exclusive experience for those who are excelling in their fitness journey, this might unintentionally exclude users who are unable to achieve top metrics due to health conditions or other personal constraints. To address this, we can allow users to opt out of the feature, which will hide the leaderboard from their app view and exclude them from being considered for the leaderboard rankings. We can also add leaderboard titles that capture the best improvement from week to week or other more accessible metrics.

- **Pervasiveness**: When **acconting for culture**, we need to consider that western culture tends to be more individualistic, while eastern cultures tend to skew more collectivist. For that reason, features like Leaderboards and Kudos might not align well with cultures that avoid spotlighting individual achievements and instead emphasize group harmony and collective effort. As a response to this, we can add a new feature called Community Goals that allows communities to set collective goals to work toward together. For example, one such goal could be to reach 500 minutes of exercise combined between all members in a week. We can also add Community Leaderboards that recognize the community that has collectively achieved the most in a given week.

- **Stakeholders**: With the Gym Locator feature, we need to consider **indirect stakeholders** like the managers/employees of gyms. Beginners who use the locator might cause a sudden influx of new members to listed gyms, leading to operational challenges like managing increased foot traffic, maintaining equipment, and ensuring adequate staff coverage. To mitigate this issue, we can modify the Gym Locator feature to also show users how busy a given gym is in order to ensure a more balanced distribution of new members.

- **Pervasiveness**: If this app achieves **widespread use** and begins to attract more experienced users, the Exercise Library may become overcrowded with advanced exercises, and the Demonstration Shorts may shift towards showcasing advanced techniques and highly fit trainers. Users might again feel like they are "too novice" within the fitness world, defeating the purpose of the app. In response to this, we can add a Community Libraries feature. These libraries would be developed by the members of each community, ensuring that the content is tailored to their specific fitness levels and needs, and ensuring that users have libraries of exercises that are all within reach for them.

- **Stakeholders**: When **considering children**, a feature like Run Routes Tracker might be particularly dangerous. While the feature only allows those you explicitly share your running routes and location with to track you, it places the responsibility on young users to determine who within their communities can be trusted with this information. In response to this, we can introduce a parental control feature that allows parents to disable location tracking and sharing, as well as limit community interactions, ensuring a safer experience for younger users.
