## Design Reflection
In developing Fit Kit, several key design decisions were made to align with the app's focus on inclusivity and community-driven support.

First, communities are allowed to exist without any members, only being deleted when the creator chooses to do so. This decision was made to maintain control for the community creator, ensuring they have ownership over the group’s existence. Alternative options, such as automatically deleting a community when the last person leaves or when the creator leaves, risk removing spaces that might still hold value to the creator or future members.

Second, I decided not to offer private communities, making all communities public and open to everyone. This approach encourages openness and inclusivity, ensuring that any user can join and participate in any community that resonates with their experiences or goals. While allowing community creators to choose between private or public communities could offer more customization, it risks creating exclusivity and limiting the opportunities for users to discover supportive spaces.

Lastly, I opted against implementing filtering by age, sport, or fitness level within communities. Instead, these details will likely be found in the community name or description. This decision was made to avoid labeling users in ways that could make them feel excluded or like they don’t fit into specific categories. While filtering by characteristics like age or fitness level might offer more targeted community-building, it also risks reinforcing divisions rather than fostering a sense of shared experience across different backgrounds.

These decisions were made to prioritize inclusivity, openness, and user autonomy, ensuring that Fit Kit remains a space where all users feel welcomed and supported in their fitness journey.
