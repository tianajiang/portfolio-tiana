# Assignment 3: Convergent Design

## Pitch
Fit Kit is a supportive, accessible fitness app designed for beginners, those struggling with consistency, and anyone seeking a more social, approachable path to health. It emphasizes personal connection and motivation through shared experiences. Users can set and track fitness goals to stay accountable. One interviewee recalled that she felt motivated to go to the gym when she made a concrete committment to do so. Users can also join communities that address their specific needs -- whether recovering from injury, managing health conditions, or connecting with others with similar fitness levels or interests. This sense of community and shared vulnerability was key for a cancer patient I interviewed who was recovering from leg surgery. She stated that seeing others with her same health conditions instead of extremely fit trainers made her feel like she was part of a supportive network rather than an outsider. Users can also create and share workout collections with friends. One interviewee struggling with staying motivated found that her mom, at a similar fitness level, had workouts that suited her perfectly, and that these workouts helped her stay motivated and not feel like too much of a novice. Finally, for those just beginning their fitness journey, Fit Kit offers a Global Exercise Library filled with user-contributed exercises to inspire and guide them along their journey. As a social platform, Fit Kit allows users to share their progress in posts, and provide encouragement using comments. Fit Kit creates an environment where users can celebrate their health journeys with inclusivity, motivation, and accountability.
## Concepts

### Posting
 
**Purpose**: Users can publish content for other users to see
 
**Operational Principle**: After a user creates a post, other users can see it
 
**State**:
```
posts: set Post
postContents: posts --> one Content
postCommunity: posts --> one Community
postAuthors: posts --> one User
postComments: posts --> set Comment
```
 
**Actions**:
```
createPost(user: User, content: Content, community: Community, out post: Post)
    add post to posts
    update postAuthors so that post --> user
    update postContent so that post --> content
    update postCommunities so that post --> community
    initialize postComments to be empty
getPost(post: Post, out content: Content, out author: User, out community: Community, out comments: set Comment)
    Retrieve content from postContents[post] and store in content
    Retrieve author from postAuthors[post] and store in author
    Retrieve community from postCommunities[post] and store in community
    Retrieve comments from postComments[post] and store in comments
deletePost(post: Post)
    Remove post from posts
    Remove mappings postAuthors[post], postContents[post], postCommunities[post], postComments[post] by setting to None
addComment(post:Post, comment:Comment)
    update postComments so that post --> postComments[post] + comment
userIsAuthor(user: User, post: Post, out userIsAuthor: Boolean)
    return if postAuthors[post] is user
```
\* exercises take the same form as posts (photo/video demonstration, caption describing how to do exercise), so we can use the posting concept to encompass both posts and what we can call "exercise posts"

### Commenting

**Purpose**: Users can comment to reply to other items
 
**Operational Principle**: After a user creates a comment on an item, when a user brings up that item, the comment is also included
 
**State**:
```
comments: set Comment
commentContents: comments --> one Content
commentAuthors: comments --> one User
commentPosts: comments --> one Post
``` 

**Actions**:
```
createComment(user: User, content: Content, post: Post, out comment: Comment)
    add comment to comments
    update commentAuthors so that comment --> user
    update commentContents so that comment --> content
    update commentPosts so that comment --> post
getComment(comment: Comment, out content: Content, out author: User, out post: Post)
    Retrieve content from commentContents[comment] and store in content
    Retrieve author from commentAuthors[comment] and store in author
    Retrieve post from commentPosts[comment] and store in post
deleteComment(comment: Comment)
    Remove comment from comments
    Remove mappings in commentAuthors[comment], commentContents[comment], commentPosts[comment] by setting to None
userIsAuthor(user: User, comment: Comment, out userIsAuthor: Boolean)
    return if commentAuthors[comment] is user
```

### Authenticating

**Purpose**: authenticate users so that app users correspond to people

**Operational Principle**: after a user registers with a username and password pair, they can authenticate as that user by providing the pair

**State**:
```
registered: set User
usernames: registered --> one String
passwords: registered --> one String
``` 

**Actions**:
```
register(username: String, password: String, out user: User)
    if username in usernames, error.
    add user to registered
    update usernames so that user --> username
    update passwords so that user --> password
authenticate(username: String, password: String, out user: User)
    if username in usernames, get user with username
    if password equals passwords[user], out user is this user, else error.
```

### Session-ing

**Purpose**: enable authenticated actions for an extended period of time

**Operational Principle**: after a session starts (and before it ends), the getUser action returns the user identified at the start

**State**:
```
active: set Session
users: active --> one User
```

**Actions**:
```
start(user: User, out session: Session)
    add session to active
    update users so that session --> user
getUser(ion: Session, out user: User)
    out user is users[session]
end(session: Session)
    remove session from active
    remove mapping users[session] by setting to None
```

### Community-ing

**Purpose**: enable users to put themselves into groups and view items in this community

**Operational Principle**: after a user creates or joins a community (and before they leave), the getCommunities action return value includes a users set that has this user

**State**: 
```
communities: set Community
communityNames: communities --> one String
communityDescriptions: communities --> one String
communityMembers: communities --> set User
communityPosts: community --> set Post
CommunityGoals: community --> set Goal
```

**Actions**:
```
createCommunity(user: User, name: String, description: String, out community: Community)
    add community to communities
    update communityNames so that community --> name
    update communityDescriptions so that community --> description
    update communityMembers so that community --> \{user,\}
    initialize communityPosts to be empty
    initialize communityGoals to be empty
getCommunity(community: Community, out name: String, out description: String, out members: set User, out posts: set Post, out goals: set Goal)
    Retrieve name from communityNames[community] and store in name
    Retrieve description from communityDescriptions[community] and store in description
    Retrieve members from communityMembers[community] and store in members
    Retrieve posts from communityPosts[community] and store in posts
    Retrieve goals from communityGoals[community] and store in goals
addGoal(community: Community, goal: Goal)
    update communityGoals so that community --> communityGoals[community] + goal
addPost(community: Community, post: Post)
    update communityPosts so that community --> communityPosts[community] + post
removePost(community: Community, post: Post)
    update communityPosts so that community --> communityPosts[community] - post
addMember(user: User, community: Community)
    update communityMembers so that community --> communityMembers[community] + user
removeMember(user: User, community: Community)
    update communityMembers so that community --> communityMembers[community] user
```


### Goal-ing

**Purpose**: Users and communitites can track progress toward a target

**Operational Principle**: after a user creates (and before they delete) a goal, the owner of the goal (either an individual user or a community) can use the addProgress action to increase the amount of progress toward that goal

**State**:
```
goals: set Goal
goalOwners: goals --> one Owner
goalDescriptions: goals --> one String
goalUnits: goals --> one Unit
goalAmounts: goals --> one Int
goalProgress: goals --> one Int
goalCreationDates: goals --> one Date
goalCompletionDates: goals --> one Date
goalIsCompleted: goals --> one Boolean
```

**Actions**:
```
setGoal(owner: Owner, description: String, unit: Unit, amount: Int, out goal: Goal)
    add goal to goals
    update goalOwners so that goal --> owner
    update goalDescriptions so that goal --> description
    update goalUnits so that goal --> unit
    update goalAmounts so that goal --> amount
    update goalCreationDates so that goal --> current date
    update goalIsCompleted so that goal --> false
    update goalProgress so that goal --> 0
updateGoal(goal: Goal, newName: String, newDescription: String, newUnit: Unit, newAmount: Int, newDate: Date)
    update goalNames so that goal --> newName
    update goalDescriptions so that goal --> newDescription
    update goalUnits so that goal --> newUnit
    update goalAmounts so that goal --> newAmount
    update goalCompletionDates so that goal --> newDate
addProgress(goal: Goal, progress: Int)
    update goalProgress so that goal --> goalProgress[goal] + progress
    if goalProgress[goal] >= goalAmounts[goal], completeGoal(goal)
completeGoal(goal: Goal)
    update goalIsCompleted so that goal --> true
ownerIsOwner(owner: Owner, goal: Goal, out userIsOwner: Boolean)
    return if goalOwners[goal] is owner
```

\* examples of unit can include kilometers (goal is to run 5km in a week), minutes (goal is to exercise for 20 minutes today), pounds (goal is to successfully lift 60 pounds), etc.

### Collection-ing

**Purpose**: users can organize items in groups

**Operational Principle**: after a user creates a collection (and before they delete it), the user can use the addPost action to add things to this collection such that when the user views this collection, the post will be there.

**State**:
```
collections: set Collection
collectionAuthors: collections --> ? one User
collectionNames: collections --> one String
collectionPosts: collections --> set Post
```

**Action**:
```
createCollection(author: User|None, name: String, out collection: Collection)
    add collection to collections
    update collectionAuthors so that collection --> author
    update collectionDescriptions so that collection --> name
getCollection(collection: Collection, out author: User|None, out ame: String, out posts: set Post)
    Retrieve name from collectionNames[collection] and store in name
    Retrieve author from collectionAuthors[collection] and store in author
    Retrieve posts from collectionPosts[collection] and store in posts
addPost(collection: Collection, post: Post)
    update collectionPosts so that collection --> collectionPosts[collection] + post
removePost(collection: Collection, post: Post)
    update collectionPosts so that collection --> collectionPosts[collection] - post
deleteCollection(collection: Collection)
    remove collection to collections
    remove mappings collectionAuthors[collection] and collectionDescriptions[collection] by setting to None
userIsAuthor(user: User, collection: Collection, out userIsOwner: Boolean)
    return if collectionAuthors[collection] is user
```
\* the global exercise library will be a collection with no author associated with it.

## Wireframing
[View my wireframe in Figma here.](https://www.figma.com/design/f5rQmRXtvEAez3GiA2Ab3T/FitKit-6.104-A3?node-id=0-1&m=dev&t=Rst6M8mpVag3dRqp-1)



## Design Tradeoff

**Community-Centric Posting**
Options:
1. allow users to post to their profile (post is not associated with a community)
2. allow users to post to both communities and their profile
3. only allow users to post in communities
I chose option 3 because the core goal of my app is to encourage users to connect with others who share similar experiences and challenges. Limiting posts to communities fosters a focused environment where users can share relevant content and connect with like-minded individuals. In the case that a user wants to post a more general post to multiple communities, we don't want to create excessive work for the user, so we ask them to select the communities to post to when creating a post.


**Goal Units Selection**
Options:
1. provide a single unit for all goals (ex. minutes of exercise)
2. provide no units so that users can have complete flexibility
3. provide predefined units (e.g., minutes, pounds, number of times)
I chose option 3 because it strikes a balance between providing guidance and allowing user flexibility. Predefined units maintain consistency in how goals are measured, making it easier for users to track their progress. While option 1 is very convenient for the user to track, it restricts them to a single metric, which may not suit everyone's needs. With option 2, users might set vague goals like "I want to run more" without a clear definition of progress and have to manually track their progress themselves. The structure of option 3 ensures users can easily understand and engage with their goals while accommodating various fitness activities. By offering a selection of units, the app caters to diverse user needs, enhancing motivation and accountability without overwhelming them with too many choices.


**Singular Open Global Library**
Options:
1. Maintain a single global exercise library that all users can access and add to
2. Maintain a single global exercise library that is static. Users cannot add to it
3. Create multiple specialized libraries (e.g., beginner, intermediate, advanced, or category-specific like soccer workouts, dance, etc.)
I chose option 1 because it promotes simplicity and ease of use. A centralized library (with searching capability) allows users to find and explore a wide range of exercises without navigating through multiple categories. Categories in option 3 can be limiting or discourage users, especially if they struggle with the exercises labeled as easy or beginner, as one of my interviewees noted. With option 2, non-traditional exercises might be left out of the Global Library, with no way for users to add them in. This contradicts the goal of my app, which aims to create an inclusive and supportive space for users from all backgrounds and fitness interests. Option 1 provides a balance between simplicity and accessibility, ensuring that all users can easily navigate the library while having access to a diverse range of exercises.
